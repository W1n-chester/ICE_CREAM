      Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
      dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a
      sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or
      vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be
      made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
